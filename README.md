# SketchSync - Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard

SketchSync is an interactive, real-time collaborative whiteboard built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Socket.IO. It enables multiple users to seamlessly draw, write, and brainstorm together on a shared canvas — all in real time. With integrated chat, dynamic drawing tools, and live room synchronization, SketchSync replicates the feel of a physical whiteboard, optimized for remote teamwork, classrooms, and creative sessions.
